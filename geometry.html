								<h2>Inversion and Sphericalization of Metric Spaces</h2>
								<br>
								</br>
                <p style="font-family: Arial;font-size: 18px">
                  Metric space geometry is a field of
									mathematics concerned with how we measure distances on a set of points. There is the distance that everybody
									learns about in middle school math, that is, the euclidean measure of distance. There exist more exotic notions
									of distances, however. Some of these notions are very practical, like the taxi-cab distance. This is a measure
									of distance using the distance that a taxi would have to drive in order to get to a destination. Some of the
									notions of distances are yet more exotic and do not have as obvious of a use in the real world. One of these
									distances is called the Ferrand distance. Dr. Herron and I worked on obtaining estimates for the Ferrand distance
									between two points by using only properties of the ambient metric space itself. We were able to set upper and lower
									limits on the Ferrand distance using quantities such as the diameter of the boundary of our metric space. This work
									we performed was based on a previous study that Dr. Herron did, <a href="assets/BHX_paper.pdf">here</a> in which
									he and his collaborators considered very similar questions about a different notion of distance, called the
									quasi-hyperbolic distance.
