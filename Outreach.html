                  Do you want to help formerly incarcerated people successfully reintegrate into society and make a lasting impact
                  on the New York City community?
                  Check out how you can volunteer your time with the Fortune Society at their website here:

                <p style="font-family: Arial;font-size: 18px">
                  The Fortune Society is an organization based in New York City that aims to successfully rehabilitate
                  and reintegrate formerly incarcerated people into society. I first became interested in working with
                  the Fortune Society when I heard from a professor at Northwestern University about a prison education
                  program that their department was involved in. I then checked out what opportunities there are in and
                  around NYC, and I quickly found many different organizations working on educating former prisoners! I firmly
                  believe that the justice system in the United States is flawed and does not regularly meet its goal of rehabilitation,
                  but rather meets the goal of punishment at the expense of rehabilitation. I also firmly believe that education
                  is one of the best ways for somebody who was incarcerated to make a step towards rehabilitation and furthering
                  their future goals.
								</p>
                <p style="font-family: Arial;font-size: 18px">
                  Why is education so important for former prisoners? Well, education is a strong predictor for recidivism. According
                  to the people's education initiative (https://nypei.org/#post-38), "in a study of federal prison recidivism, 60.4% of people who did
                  not complete high school were reincarcerated within eight years, compared to just 19.1% of college graduates. Additionally,
                  prison education decreases recidivism by 43% according to a recent meta-analysis." By educating formerly incarcerated people,
                  I hope to reduce their risk of recidivism and help them lead happy and meaningful lives in the future.
