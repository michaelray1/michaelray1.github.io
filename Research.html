								<p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 18px"> I have had the pleasure of working with some incredible scientists and mentors at
										the University of Cincinnati, and more recently at Stony Brook University.
										Below you can find a description of all the major research projects I have
										been involved with thus far. A comprehensive list of my
										accomplishments can be found in my CV <a href="assets/MichaelRay_CVcopy.pdf">here</a>.

								<h2>Computational Astrophysics</h2>
								<br>
								</br>
								<p style="font-family: Arial;font-size: 18px">My current work is in the field of computational astrophysics, where I have
										been working with Dr. Rosalba Perna and her collaborators. I am working on two projects at current.
								</p>
								<p style="font-family: Arial;font-size: 18px">
										The first project is investigating
										possible explanations for why we see hot jupiters in our universe. Hot jupiters
										are jupiter-like planets (large and gaseous planets) which orbit very close to their
										host stars. When these were first discovered in 1995, they were quite a surprise to astronomers,
										because our current theory of planet formation predicts that planets as large as jupiter
										cannot form much closer to their sun than where our jupiter orbits. So, if we are to accept
										our current planet formation theory, then we must explain how these hot jupiters could
										have gotten to where they are without initially forming there. The theories we are interested
										in posit that a some of these hot jupiters could have formed far out in their solar
										system and then migrated inwards due to an external body such as another star perturbing
										the orbits of the planets in the system.
								</p>
								<p style="font-family: Arial;font-size: 18px">
										The second project in this field that I am involved in has to deal with how radiation
										is affected as it travels through a dense volume of space, such as near the center of
										a galaxy. In these very dense environments, light that is emmitted from a source gets
										changed quite a bit before it reaches our telescope. There are a variety of things that
										could happen to the light, such as it could be absorbed by a Hydrogen molecule, which
										could then emit another photon. Since there are so many things which could happen to the
										light on its way to our telescope, it is sometimes quite tricky for astronomers to figure
										out what emmitted the light that we observe. My project here is to use a radiative transfer
										code to figure out what our telescopes would observe if gamma rays were emmitted in the
										environment of an active galactic nuclei.

								<h2>Quantum Field Theory
								</h2>
								<br>
								</br>
								<p style="font-family: Arial;font-size: 18px">
									Under the supervision of Dr. Philip Argyres, I have worked on a number of problems in quantum
									field theory and mathematical physics. I began work with Dr. Argyres in the spring of 2020
									and have continued to work with him since then. The problem we are focused on currently
									has to do with understanding the space of lowest energy states of N=4 Supersymmetric
									Yang-Mills theories. This class of theories contain artificial symmetries which are not observed
									in nature, but which allow us to get a much better hold on the predictions of the theory. Studying
									these theories will help physicists to better understand our true physical models of the world such
									as the standard model of particle physics.
								</p>
								<p style="font-family: Arial;font-size: 18px">
									You can see a technical description of the problem
									we are currently working on
								  in my senior thesis <a href="assets/Senior_capstone_physics.pdf">here</a>. Also associated
									with my senior thesis is a poster that you can see below.

								<h2>Cosmology
								</h2>
								<br>
								</br>
								<p style="font-family: Arial;font-size: 18px">
									My very first research experience in physics came back in the spring of 2018 under the supervision
									of Dr. Colin Bischoff. I continued work with Dr. Bischoff until the spring of 2020. This
									work was in the field of cosmology. Dr. Bischoff and I worked on developing a filter
									for CMB data which was meant to provide a reconstructed map of the CMB in which we only keep
									the divergence-free component of the light. These divergence-free components are called
									B-modes and they contain information about the early universe. Of particular interest to Dr.
									Bischoff's work is the fact that inflationary gravitational waves, if they existed in the early universe,
									would leave an imprint on the CMB in the form of B-modes. Therefore, obtaining an estimate of the
									B-mode signal is of importance for answering the question of whether inflation happened in our universe.
								</p>
								<p style="font-family: Arial;font-size: 18px">
									Unfortunately for us, the B-mode signal in the CMB is very faint compared to the E-mode signal (this is the
									curl-free component of the light).
									In addition, when telescopes (such as the BICEP/Keck array at the South Pole) are connected to the Earth,
									they only observe a portion of the sky. Measurements of polarized light are local measurements, though.
									Because of this, near the edge of the telecope's observing area,
									we cannot unambiguously distinguish between E-modes and B-modes. This is where our filter comes in.
									Our filter iteratively solves for the Wiener filter reconstruction of our data. That is, our filter
									outputs the map which minimizes chi-squared, or equivalently, the error in our measurement. You can see
									a demonstration of this in the figure below. It shows that our filter resulted in a lower variance
									(error bar size) when compared to the S2-hat estimator, which is currently used in the BICEP/Keck
									analysis pipeline.

								<p style="font-family: Arial;font-size: 18px">
									The code developed
									for this project is open source and available on my GitHub account <a href="https://github.com/michaelray1/messenger_method">here</a>.
									Also in that GitHub repository is a jupyter notebook which gives a demonstration of how the code works.
									A logbook posting in the CMBS-4 collaboration which was authored by Dr. Bischoff and myself can be found
									<a href="https://cmb-s4.uchicago.edu/wiki/index.php/PureB_by_Messenger_Method">here</a>. A poster for this
									work can be seen below.

								<h2>Metric Space Geometry
								</h2>
								<br>
								</br>
								<p>
									During my senior year at UC, for my mathematics capstone, I spent a year working with Dr. David Herron
									in the math department at UC on a project in metric space geometry. Metric space geometry is a field of
									mathematics concerned with how we measure distances on a set of points. There is the distance that everybody
									learns about in middle school math, that is, the euclidean measure of distance. There exist more exotic notions
									of distances, however. Some of these notions are very practical, like the taxi-cab distance. This is a measure
									of distance using the distance that a taxi would have to drive in order to get to a destination. Some of the
									notions of distances are yet more exotic and do not have as obvious of a use in the real world. One of these
									distances is called the Ferrand distance. Dr. Herron and I worked on obtaining estimates for the Ferrand distance
									between two points by using only properties of the ambient metric space itself. We were able to set upper and lower
									limits on the Ferrand distance using quantities such as the diameter of the boundary of our metric space. This work
									we performed was based on a previous study that Dr. Herron did, <a href="assets/BHX_paper.pdf">here</a> in which
									he and his collaborators considered very similar questions about a different notion of distance, called the
									quasi-hyperbolic distance.
