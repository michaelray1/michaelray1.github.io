								<h2>Absorption of Gamma-Ray Bursts by Active Galactic Nuclei</h2>
								<br>
								</br>
								<p style="font-family: Arial;font-size: 18px">
                  My current project and the one that is the topic of my master's thesis
                  has to deal with how radiation
                  is affected as it travels through a dense volume of space, such as near the center of
                  a galaxy. In these very dense environments, light that is emmitted from a source gets
                  changed quite a bit before it reaches our telescope. There are a variety of things that
                  could happen to the light, such as it could be absorbed and/or re-emitted.
                  Since there are many things which could happen to the
                  light on its way to our telescope, it is sometimes quite tricky for astronomers to figure
                  out what emmitted the light that we observe. My project here is to use a radiative transfer
                  code to figure out what our telescopes would observe if gamma rays were emmitted in the
                  environment of an active galactic nucleus.
								</p>
                <p style="font-family: Arial;font-size: 18px">
                  The more general goal here is to understand what it looks like when many gamma-ray bursts
                  are all going off inside of a galaxy and their light is all getting absorbed and changed
                  by the environment. Having a better grasp of this will help us to identify the cause of
                  the variability we observe in active galactic nuclei luminosities. It is suspected that
                  many gamma-ray bursts occurring inside of active galactic nuclei could provide enough
                  luminosity to account for the observed variability which, to date, remains unexplained.
                  For a deep-dive into my work, see my master's thesis
                  <a href="assets/Masters_Thesis_FD.pdf">here</a>.
