								<h2>N=4 Super Yang-Mills Theories and Their Spaces of Vacua</h2>
								<br>
								</br>
								<p style="font-family: Arial;font-size: 18px">
                  I began work with Dr. Argyres in the spring of 2020
									and have continued to work with him since then. The problem we focused on
									has to do with understanding the space of lowest energy states of N=4 Supersymmetric
									Yang-Mills theories. This class of theories are quantum field theories that are built
                  out of an underlying Lie Group and Lie Algebra. They also contain artificial symmetries
                  which are not observed
									in nature, but which allow us to get a much better hold on the predictions, or the dynamics,
                  of the theory. Studying
									these theories will help physicists to better understand our true physical models of the world such
									as the standard model of particle physics.

                <p style="font-family: Arial;font-size: 18px">
                  Just recently, in the spring of 2022, Dr. Argyres and I released
                  a paper alongside Dr. Mario Martone from King's College London.
                  This paper is associated with this work, and contains an interesting calculation
                  which illuminates a misunderstanding that many researchers in the field previously
                  had. You can find the paper on the ArXiv
                  <a href="assets/Dirac_pairing_paperCopy.pdf">here</a>.
									You can also see a technical description of the problem
								  in my senior thesis <a href="assets/Senior_capstone_physics.pdf">here</a>. This thesis
                  describes the relevant problem we worked on at a level that is one step down from
                  the level that the paper is written at. Thus, it is appropriate for those with an
                  undergraduate degree in physics or mathematics.
                  Lastly, associated
									with my senior thesis is also a poster that you can see below.
